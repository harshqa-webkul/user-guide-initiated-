The **Payments** section in AureusERP enables you to efficiently record and manage customer payments, handle invoice settlements, and monitor transaction states just like a standard ERP workflow. Below is the **step-by-step** guide to creating an Payment.

## Payment Creation

## Payment Lifecycle & States

Once you click **Create**, the payment record is saved and redirects to the **View Payment** page. The payment enters the **`Draft`** state.

### ðŸŽ¯ Payment States

- **Draft** â€“ The initial state when the payment is created.
- **In Process** â€“ After clicking **Confirm**, the payment starts processing.
- **Paid** â€“ Indicates that the payment was successfully completed and matched to an invoice.
- **Not Paid** â€“ Used if the payment fails or is marked as unpaid.
- **Cancelled** â€“ The payment was intentionally cancelled before completion.
- **Rejected** â€“ The payment was declined or failed system validation.

## Available Actions (Post-Creation)

From the **View Payment** page, you can perform the following actions:

- **Edit** â€“ Modify payment details (available in `Draft` state only).
- **Delete** â€“ Remove the payment entry before confirmation.
- **Confirm** â€“ Move the payment to `In Process` and begin settlement.
- **Cancel** â€“ Cancel the payment at any time before it becomes `Paid`.

## ðŸ§¾ Invoice Settlement Logic

If a payment is linked to a customer invoice, the system attempts to automatically reconcile the payment with any open invoices associated with the selected customer.

- **Full Payment**: If the payment amount matches the invoice total, the invoice is marked as **Paid**.
- **Partial Payment**: If less than the total is paid, the invoice shows as **Partially Paid**. You can settle the remaining balance with another payment later.

Reconciliation happens automatically based on customer and open invoice matching. Manual reconciliation can be handled separately if needed.

## Example Flow

1. **Create Payment**

   - Type: `Receive`
   - Amount: `$1,000`
   - Linked to: `INV/2025/05/101`

2. **Confirm Payment**

   - State changes to `In Process`

3. **Automatic Invoice Matching**

   - The system finds `INV/2025/05/101` and applies the payment.

4. **Settlement Complete**
   - Invoice marked as `Paid`
   - Payment status updated to `Paid`
